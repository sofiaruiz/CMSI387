CMSI 387 Operating Systems
	Semester Project
===================================

This is a wonderful idea.  Having this kind of list would be very
useful to system administrators as well as normal users.  Having it
be part of the kernel means there is access to more lower-level
resources as well.

There are already operating system tools in place that do this
ABOVE the kernel level, but encapsulating the operations into the 
kernel is a worthy project!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
