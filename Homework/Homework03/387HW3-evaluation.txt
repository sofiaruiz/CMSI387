Comments:
---------
I initially got a syntax error from your dining philosophers program, but I fixed
it and it ran fine.

I had trouble with your problem_four.cpp though.  I couldn't get it to build, and
it kept giving me linker errors.  I wasn't able to get that fixed, but your code
looks correct, so I gave you partial credit.

Nice work!

Semester so far:

   homework01 @ 10%:  100.00% = 10.00 points
   homework02 @ 10%:  100.00% = 10.00 points
   homework03 @ 10%:   93.75% =  9.38 points
   particip.  @ 10%:  100.00% = 10.00 points
   proj pt. 1 @ 20%:  100.00% = 20.00 points

       total points:  59.38 out of 60.00 = 98.97% which is an A-plus
